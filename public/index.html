    <p>My name is Nick. Iâ€™m a software engineer in Atlanta, GA. I currently work for Stable Kernel where I develop mobile apps and occasionally websites. I primarily work in Android, though I am not afraid to jump in and try almost anything.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in Kennesaw, GA and went to Georgia Tech to study Computer Science. I have a wife and a dog and we currently live in a small neighborhood of Atlanta called Mozley Park.</p>
